# flepimop_sample

This repository mirrors the contents in the **examples/tutorial** folder of the FlepiMoP repository ([link](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP/tree/main/examples/tutorials)). It can be used to try out running simple projects using `flepimop` code and as a template for new projects.
