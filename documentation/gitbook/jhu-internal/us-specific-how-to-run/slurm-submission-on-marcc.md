# Running on Rockfish/MARCC - JHU ü™®üê†

## üóÇÔ∏è Files and folder organization

Rockfish administrators provided [several partitions](https://www.arch.jhu.edu/support/storage-and-filesystems/) with different properties. For our needs (storage intensive and shared environment), we work in the `/scratch4/struelo1/` partition, where we have 20T of space. Our folders are organized as:

* **code-folder:** `/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/` where each user has its own subfolder, from where the repos are cloned and the runs are launched. e.g for user chadi, we'll find:
  * `/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/chadi/covidsp/Flu_USA`
  * `/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/chadi/COVID19_USA`
  * `/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/chadi/flepiMoP`
  * ...
  * (we keep separated repositories by users so that different versions of the pipeline are not mixed where we run several runs in parallel. Don't hesitate to create other subfolders in the code folder (`/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/chadi-flusight`, ...) if you need them.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that the repository is cloned **flat,** i.e the `flepiMoP` repository is at the same level as the data repository, not inside it!
{% endhint %}

* **output folder:**`/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-runs` stores the run outputs. After an inference run finishes, it's output and the logs files are copied from the `$PROJECT_PATH/model_output` to `/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-runs/THISRUNJOBNAME` where the jobname is usually of the form `USA-DATE.`

{% hint style="warning" %}
When logging on you'll see two folders `data_struelo1` and `scr4_struelo1`, which are shortcuts to `/data/struelo1` and `/scratch4/struelo1`. We don't use `data/struelo1`.
{% endhint %}

## Login on rockfish

Using ssh from your terminal, type in:

```
ssh {YOUR ROCKFISH USERNAME}@login.rockfish.jhu.edu
```

and enter your password when prompted. You'll be into rockfish's login node, which is a remote computer whose only purpose is to prepare and launch computations on so-called compute nodes.

## üß± Setup (to be done only once per USER )

Load the right modules for the setup:

```bash
module purge
module load gcc/9.3.0
module load anaconda3/2022.05  # very important to pin this version as other are buggy
module load git                # needed for git
module load git-lfs            # git-lfs (do we still need it?)
```

Now, type the following line so git remembers your credential and you don't have to enter your token 6 times per day:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global user.name "{NAME SURNAME}"
git config --global user.email YOUREMAIL@EMAIL.COM
git config --global pull.rebase false # so you use merge as the default reconciliation method
```

Now you need to create the conda environment. You will create the environment in two shorter commands, installing the python and R stuff separately. This can be extremely long if done in one command, so doing it in two helps. This command is quite long you'll have the time to brew some nice coffee ‚òïÔ∏è:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# install all python stuff first
conda create -c conda-forge -n flepimop-env numba pandas numpy seaborn tqdm matplotlib click confuse pyarrow sympy dask pytest scipy graphviz emcee xarray boto3 slack_sdk

# activate the enviromnment and install the R stuff
conda activate flepimop-env
conda install -c conda-forge r-readr r-sf r-lubridate r-tigris r-tidyverse r-gridextra r-reticulate r-truncnorm r-xts r-ggfortify r-flextable r-doparallel r-foreach r-arrow r-optparse r-devtools r-tidycensus r-cdltools r-cowplot 
```
{% endcode %}

### Clone the FlepiMoP and other model repositories

Use the following commands to have git clone the FlepiMoP repository and any other model repositories you'd like to work on through `https`. In the code below, $USER is a variable that contains your username.

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>cd /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/
</strong><strong>mkdir $USER
</strong><strong>cd $USER
</strong>git clone https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP.git
git clone https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/Flu_USA.git
# or any other model repositories
</code></pre>

You will be prompted to provide your GitHub username and password. Note that from 2021, GitHub has changed the use of passwords to the use of [personal acces tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens), so the prompted "password" is not the password you use to login. Instead, we recommend using the more safe `ssh` protocol to clone GitHub repositories. To do so, first [generate an ssh private-public keypair](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux) on the Rockfish cluster and then copy the generated public key from the Rockfish cluster to your local computer by opening a terminal and prompting,

`scp -r <username>@rfdtn1.rockfish.jhu.edu:/home/<username>/.ssh/<key_name.pub> .`

Then [add the public key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to your GitHub account. Next, make a file `~/.ssh/config` by `using the command `vi ~/.ssh/config`. Press 'I' to go into insert mode and paste the following chunck of code,

```
Host github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<key_name>
```

Press 'esc' to exit INSERT model followed by ':x' to save and exit the file. By adding this configuration file, you make sure Rockfish doesn't forget your ssh key when you log out. Now clone the github repositories as follows,

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>cd /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/
</strong><strong>mkdir $USER
</strong><strong>cd $USER
</strong>git clone git@github.com:HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP.git
git clone git@github.com:HopkinsIDD/Flu_USA.git
# or any other model repositories
</code></pre>

and you will not be prompted for credentials.

### Setup your Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials

This can be done in a second step -- but is necessary in order to push and pull data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Setup AWS by running,

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash">cd ~ # go in your home directory
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
./aws/install -i ~/aws-cli -b ~/aws-cli/bin
<strong>./aws-cli/bin/aws --version
</strong></code></pre>

Then run `./aws-cli/bin/aws configure` to set up your credentials,

```
# AWS Access Key ID [None]: Access key
# AWS Secret Access Key [None]: Secret Access key
# Default region name [None]: us-west-2
# Default output format [None]: json
```

To get the (secret) access key, ask the AWS administrator (Shaun Truelove) to generate them for you.

## üöÄ Run inference using slurm (do everytime)

log-in to rockfish via ssh, then type:

```
source /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/$USER/flepiMoP/batch/slurm_init.sh
```

which will prepare the environment and setup variables for the validation date (choose as day after `end_date_groundtruth`), the resume location and the run index for this run. If you don't want to set a variable, just hit enter.

{% hint style="success" %}
Note that now the run-id of the run we resume from is automatically inferred by the batch script :)
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>what does this do || it returns an error</summary>

This script runs the following commands to setup up the environment, which you can run individually as well.

```bash
module purge
module load gcc/9.3.0
module load git
module load git-lfs
module load slurm
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda activate flepimop-env
export CENSUS_API_KEY={A CENSUS API KEY}
export FLEPI_RESET_CHIMERICS=TRUE
export FLEPI_PATH=/scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/$USER/flepiMoP

# And then it asks you some questions to setup some enviroment variables
```

and the it does some prompts to fix the following 3 enviroment variables. You can skip this part and do it later manually.

```bash
export VALIDATION_DATE="2023-01-29"
export RESUME_LOCATION=s3://idd-inference-runs/USA-20230122T145824
export FLEPI_RUN_INDEX=FCH_R16_lowBoo_modVar_ContRes_blk4_Jan29_tsvacc
```

</details>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Check that the conda environment is activated: you should see`(flepimop-env)` on the left of your command-line prompt.
{% endhint %}

Then prepare the pipeline directory (if you have already done that and the pipeline hasn't been updated (`git pull` says it's up to date) then you can skip these steps

```bash
cd /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/$USER
export FLEPI_PATH=$(pwd)/flepiMoP
cd $FLEPI_PATH
git checkout main
git pull

# install dependencies ggraph and tidy graph
R
> install.packages(c("ggraph","tidygraph"))
> quit()

# install the R module
Rscript build/local_install.R # warnings are ok; there should be no error.

# install gempyor
pip install --no-deps -e flepimop/gempyor_pkg/
```

Now flepiMoP is ready üéâ. If the `R` command doesn't work, try `r` and if that doesn't work run `module load `r/4.0.2`.

Next step is to setup the data. First $PROJECT\_PATH to your data folder, and set any data options. If you are using the Delph Epidata API, first register for a key here: [https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/). Once you have a key, add that below where you see \[YOUR API KEY]. Alternatively, you can put that key in your config file in the `inference` section as `gt_api_key: "YOUR API KEY"`.

For a COVID-19 run, do:

```bash
cd /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/$USER
export PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd)/COVID19_USA
export GT_DATA_SOURCE="csse_case, fluview_death, hhs_hosp"
export DELPHI_API_KEY="[YOUR API KEY]"
```

for Flu do:

```bash
cd /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/$USER
export PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd)/Flu_USA
```

Now for any type of run:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_PATH
git pull 
git checkout main
```

Do some clean-up before your run. The fast way is to restore the `$PROJECT_PATH` git repository to its blank states (‚ö†Ô∏è removes everything that does not come from git):

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>git reset --hard &#x26;&#x26; git clean -f -d  # this deletes everything that is not on github in this repo !!!
</strong></code></pre>

<details>

<summary>I want more control over what is deleted</summary>

if you prefer to have more control, delete the files you like, e.g

If you still want to use git to clean the repo but want finer control or to understand how dangerous is the command, [read this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1090309/git-undo-all-working-dir-changes-including-new-files).

```bash
rm -rf model_output data/us_data.csv data-truth &&
   rm -rf data/mobility_territories.csv data/geodata_territories.csv &&
   rm -rf data/seeding_territories.csv && 
   rm -rf data/seeding_territories_Level5.csv data/seeding_territories_Level67.csv

# don't delete model_output if you have another run in //
rm -rf $PROJECT_PATH/model_output
# delete log files from previous runs
rm *.out
```

</details>

Run the preparatory script for the data and you are good,

```bash
export CONFIG_PATH=config_FCH_R16_lowBoo_modVar_ContRes_blk4_Jan29_tsvacc.yml
Rscript $FLEPI_PATH/datasetup/build_US_setup.R

# For covid do
Rscript $FLEPI_PATH/datasetup/build_covid_data.R

# For Flu (do not do this for the scenariohub!)
R
> install.packages(c("RSocrata"))
Rscript $FLEPI_PATH/datasetup/build_flu_data.R

# build seeding
Rscript $FLEPI_PATH/datasetup/build_initial_seeding.R
```

If you want to profile how the model is using your memory resources during the run:

```
export FLEPI_MEM_PROFILE=TRUE
export FLEPI_MEM_PROF_ITERS=50
```

Now you may want to test that it works :

```bash
flepimop-inference-main -c $CONFIG_PATH -j 1 -n 1 -k 1 
```

If this fails, you may want to investigate this error. In case this succeeds, then you can proceed by first deleting the model\_output:

```
rm -r model_output
```

### Launch your inference batch job

When an inference batch job is launched, a few post processing scripts are called to run automatically `postprocessing-scripts.sh.` You can manually change what you want to run by editing this script.

Now you're fully set to go üéâ

To launch the whole inference batch job, type the following command:

```bash
python $FLEPI_PATH/batch/inference_job_launcher.py --slurm 2>&1 | tee $FLEPI_RUN_INDEX_submission.log
```

This command infers everything from you environment variables, if there is a resume or not, what is the run\_id, etc. The part after the "2" makes sure this file output is redirected to a script for logging, but has no impact on your submission.

If you'd like to have more control, you can specify the arguments manually:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>python $FLEPI_PATH/batch/inference_job_launcher.py --slurm \
</strong><strong>                    -c $CONFIG_PATH \
</strong><strong>                    -p $FLEPI_PATH \
</strong><strong>                    --data-path $PROJECT_PATH \
</strong><strong>                    --upload-to-s3 True \
</strong><strong>                    --id $FLEPI_RUN_INDEX \
</strong><strong>                    --fs-folder /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-runs \
</strong><strong>                    --restart-from-location $RESUME_LOCATION
</strong></code></pre>

If you want to send any post-processing outputs to `#flepibot-test` instead of `csp-production`, add the flag `--slack-channel debug`

**Commit files to Github.** After the job is successfully submitted, you will now be in a new branch of the data repo. Commit the ground truth data files to the branch on github and then return to the main branch:

<pre><code><strong>git add data/ 
</strong>git commit -m"scenario run initial" 
branch=$(git branch | sed -n -e 's/^\* \(.*\)/\1/p')
git push --set-upstream origin $branch
</code></pre>

but DO NOT finish up by git checking main like the aws instructions, as the run will use data in the current folder.

### Monitor your run

TODO JPSEH WRITE UP TO HERE

Two types of logfiles: in \`$PROJECT\_PATH\`: slurm-JOBID\_SLOTID.out and and filter\_MC logs:

\`\`\`tail -f /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-runs/USA-20230130T163847/log\_FCH\_R16\_lowBoo\_modVar\_ContRes\_blk4\_Jan29\_tsvacc\_100.txt

\`\`\`

### Helpful commands

When approching the file number quota, type

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | while read -r dir
 do printf "%s:\t" "$dir"; find "$dir" -type f | wc -l; done 
```

to find which subfolders contains how many files

## Common errors

* Check that the python comes from conda with `which python` if some weird package missing errors arrive. Sometime conda magically disappears.
* Don't use `ipython` as it breaks click's flags

cleanup:

```
rm -r /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-runs/
rm -r model_output
cd $COVID_PATH;git pull;cd $PROJECT_PATH
rm *.out
```

### Get a notification on your phone/mail when a run is done

We use [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) for notification. Install ntfy on your Iphone or Android device. Then subscribe to the channel `ntfy.sh/flepimop_alerts` where you'll receive notifications when runs are done.

* End of job notifications goes as urgent priority.

## How to use slurm

Check your running jobs:

```
squeue -u $USER
```

where job\_id has your full array job\_id and each slot after the under-score. You can see their status (R: running, P: pending), how long they have been running and soo on.

To cancel a job

```
scancel JOB_ID
```

### Running an interactive session

To check your code prior to submitting a large batch job, it's often helpful to run an interactive session to debug your code and check everything works as you want. On ü™®üê† this can be done using `interact` like the below line, which requests an interactive session with 4 cores, 24GB of memory, for 12 hours.

```
interact -p defq -n 4 -m 24G -t 12:00:00
```

The options here are `[-n tasks or cores]`, `[-t walltime]`, `[-p partition]` and `[-m memory]`, though other options can also be included or modified to your requirements. More details can be found on the [ARCH User Guide](https://marcc.readthedocs.io/Slurm.html#request-interactive-jobs).

### Moving files to your local computer

Often you'll need to move files back and forth between Rockfish and your local computer. To do this, you can use Open-On-Demand, or any other command line tool.

`scp -r <user>@rfdtn1.rockfish.jhu.edu:"<file path of what you want>" <where you want to put it in your local>`

## Installation notes

These steps are already done an affects all users, but might be interesting in case you'd like to run on another cluster

#### Install slack integration

So our ü§ñ-friend can send us some notifications once a run is done.

```
cd /scratch4/struelo1/flepimop-code/
nano slack_credentials.sh
# and fill the file:
export SLACK_WEBHOOK="{THE SLACK WEBHOOK FOR CSP_PRODUCTION}"
export SLACK_TOKEN="{THE SLACK TOKEN}"
```
